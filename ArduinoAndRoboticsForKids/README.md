# Arduino And Robotics For Kids

A fun course learning about electronic circuits and robotics.

Text Book: TBA

- What is a robot?
  Different kinds of robots: Humanoid, like C3PO or Commander Data, quasi 
  humanoid robots like the robots from Lost In Space or The Forbidden Planet.
  Non-humanoid robots like R2D2 or Number 5. Robotic dogs from Boston 
  Dynamics.  iRobot Roomba. Non-mobile industrial robots. (Pictures!)

  How robots work. Motors for muscles.  Sensors to help robots "see".  
  Batteries to give robots the energy to operate.
  
- Arduino and Electronics
  LEDs and resistors: Blink a LED.
  Transistors and Motors: using a transistor to do the heavy lifting.
  LDRs to sense how bright it is.
  Using sound to navigate like a bat: using an ultrasonic sensor to measure 
  distance. 

- Assembling a wheeled platform for our robot
  Writing programs to control moving around: forwards and backwards, 
    turning left and right.
    
- Adding ultrasonic sensors to our wheeled platform
  Avoiding crashes into walls and obstacles.
  
- Adding a gripper to our robot.
  Picking things up and carrying them around and putting them down.
